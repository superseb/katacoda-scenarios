# Run Rancher

The node `node01` is used to run Rancher. For this scenario we are using Docker to run Rancher, referred in the documentation as [Single Node Install](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.x/en/installation/single-node/)

`docker run --privileged -d --restart=unless-stopped -p 80:80 -p 443:443 rancher/rancher:latest`{{execute HOST2}}

Rancher should be accessible within 60 seconds after pulling the Docker image. You can use the following command to check if Rancher is ready:

`while true; do curl -sLk https://127.0.0.1/ping && break; sleep 2; done`{{execute HOST2}}

You can access Rancher using the following URL:

https://[[HOST2_SUBDOMAIN]]-443-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com/

You should be prompted for setting a password.
