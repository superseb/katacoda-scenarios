Note: This environment runs the latest available v2.5 release of `rancher/rancher`. Please refer to the [official documentation](https://docs.rancher.com) how to setup Rancher in production.

This scenario will deploy [Rancher](https://rancher.com) (complete container management platform), it will also setup a single node [RKE2](https://github.com/rancher/rke2) cluster and automatically import that into Rancher for management.
