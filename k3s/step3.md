# Create and access workload

Now we are ready to deploy a workload and access it. The first host has a template file at `/root/rancher-demo.yaml.tpl` which we can use to deploy a web page showing the amount of pods running for a Deployment.

`cat /root/rancher-demo.yaml.tpl | sed 's/__HOSTNAME__/[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-80-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com/g' | k3s kubectl create -f -`{{execute HOST1}}

Wait for the pods to be running:

`k3s kubectl rollout status deploy/rancher-demo`{{execute HOST1}}

Now you can access the created workload by clicking on the following link:

https://[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-80-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com/

After checking it out, scale the deployment to more replicas and see the result:

`k3s kubectl scale deploy/rancher-demo --replicas=5`{{execute HOST1}}
